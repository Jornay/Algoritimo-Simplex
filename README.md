## ðŸ“ƒ About

This project involves the creation of an algorithm that facilitates the solution to many linear programming problems. The most common use of Simplex is to maximize a result, i.e., find the highest possible value for a total.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technology:

- C#

## ðŸ“¥ How to Download the Project

You can clone the repository using Git Bash:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Jornay/Simplex-Algorithm

# Enter the directory
$ cd Simplex-Algorithm
```
You can also clone the repository directly from the web:

    Access the link: https://github.com/Jornay/Simplex-Algorithm
    Click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."

## ðŸ’¿ How to Run the Project
<h2>1) Execution via Visual Studio:</h2>

    Open Visual Studio.
    Select the project file.
    After opening the project in Visual Studio, select the file called "Program.cs" and click the run button.
    The program will run and demonstrate the results.

<h2>2) Execution via the Executable:</h2>

Note: This method will not display the source code.

    In the folder where the project was cloned, access the folder named "Exec_Project".
    Inside that folder, find the executable named "Simplex.exe" and run it.
    The results calculated by the algorithm will be displayed.

## ðŸ”§ Developed by Lucas de Abreu

Improvements made:
- Adjusted the formatting of headings.
- Improved the project description.
- Corrected the spelling of "algorithm."
- Added links in the table of contents for easier navigation.
- Improved the description of how to download the project.
- Added subsections for the sections on how to run the project.
- Included a link to the developer's profile.
- Improved clarity in various parts of the README.
